**Trade Reporting Maturity & Granularity Analysis**

This project analyzes international trade reporting metadata to assess the maturity, coverage, and granularity of import data across countries and over time. Rather than focusing on trade values, the analysis evaluates how trade data is reported — including reporting continuity, classification detail, and publication completeness.

**Using Excel for initial exploration and Power BI for interactive visualization, the project examines:**

  Country-wise and year-wise reporting coverage.
  Evolution of HS classification granularity (H0–H6, S1–S3).
  Adoption of higher-detail reporting standards across countries.
  Reporting gaps, late publications, and historical data limitations.

The resulting dashboards help identify **reliable periods and countries** suitable for detailed downstream trade analysis and demonstrate how trade reporting standards have evolved over time.

**Tools & Skills**

  Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Interactive Dashboards).
  Excel (Pivot Tables, Data Validation).
  Metadata Analysis.
  Time-Series & Coverage Analysis.
